# Bear Essentials #1: Building Psychological Safety in Remote Teams

Hey there! üëã

Welcome to the very first edition of **Bear Essentials** üêª ‚Äî your bi-weekly dose of engineering leadership insights, distilled and thoughtful (no fluff, I promise).

I'm Miguel Tineo, and I've spent the last 10+ years leading engineering teams at companies like Hive, Dutchie, and Zendesk. I started this newsletter to share what I've learned about building great teams, scaling systems, and navigating the messy reality of modern engineering leadership.

If you're wondering "why a bear?" ‚Äî bears are thoughtful, strategic, and they know how to find the good stuff (honey = insights). Plus, "Bear Essentials" is a terrible pun I couldn't resist.

## This Week: Psychological Safety in Remote Teams

The #1 factor that differentiates high-performing teams from mediocre ones isn't technical skill, processes, or tools.

It's **psychological safety** ‚Äî the ability for team members to take risks, share ideas, and admit mistakes without fear of punishment or embarrassment.

And in remote/distributed teams? It's even harder to build.

In this week's post, I share:

- **Why psychological safety matters** (backed by Google's Project Aristotle research)
- **The unique challenges** of building trust in remote environments
- **5 practical strategies** you can implement this week
- **How to measure progress** so you know it's working

## Key Takeaway

The fastest way to build psychological safety? **Model vulnerability as a leader.**

In your next team meeting, start with: *"I made a mistake this week when I..."*

It sounds simple, but this single action signals that it's okay to be imperfect and creates space for others to do the same.

## What's Coming Next

In the next edition (2 weeks from now), I'll cover:

**"The Engineering Manager's Guide to Effective 1-on-1s"** ‚Äî how to make one-on-ones actually useful instead of awkward status updates.
