# 3D Wireframe Visibility Fix - Summary

## Issue
The 3D wireframe sphere animation was barely visible in light mode, while being perfect in dark mode.

## Solution
Increased the opacity of the light mode wireframe from 0.25 to 0.40 (60% increase).

## Changes Made

### File Modified
- `/Users/user/hack/miketineo/miketineo.com/js/webgl-background.js`

### Specific Changes
1. **Light mode primary color** (line 60):
   - Before: `rgba(255, 138, 91, 0.25)`
   - After: `rgba(255, 138, 91, 0.40)`

2. **Light mode accent color** (line 61):
   - Before: `rgba(91, 200, 204, 0.2)`
   - After: `rgba(91, 200, 204, 0.35)`

3. **Base opacity in animate function** (line 411):
   - Before: `const baseOpacity = theme === 'dark' ? 0.15 : 0.25;`
   - After: `const baseOpacity = theme === 'dark' ? 0.15 : 0.40;`

### Dark Mode
- **No changes** - Dark mode remains perfect at 0.15 opacity

## Testing Process

### Visual Testing with Puppeteer
1. Served site locally on `http://localhost:8765/`
2. Captured screenshots in both light and dark modes
3. Tested multiple opacity values: 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50
4. Selected 0.40 as optimal balance between visibility and subtlety

### Opacity Comparison Results
- **0.25 (original)**: Barely visible, poor contrast
- **0.35**: Better but still too subtle
- **0.40**: Perfect balance - clearly visible, elegant ✓
- **0.45**: Good visibility but slightly too strong
- **0.50**: Too prominent, loses professional subtlety

### Verification
- ✓ Wireframe now clearly visible in light mode
- ✓ Maintains professional, subtle aesthetic
- ✓ Good contrast against light background
- ✓ Text remains fully readable
- ✓ Dark mode unchanged (still perfect)
- ✓ Theme switching works smoothly
- ✓ No performance impact
- ✓ Animation quality preserved

## Next Steps
1. Test on production environment
2. Verify on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Check on various screen sizes and devices
4. Deploy to production via GitHub Actions

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Significantly improved - users can now see the awe-inspiring 3D wireframe animation in light mode
- **Design Consistency**: Light mode now matches the visual impact of dark mode
- **Accessibility**: Better contrast improves visibility for all users
- **Performance**: No impact - same rendering process, just different opacity values
