## Example Newsletter #1 (Psychological Safety)

```
Subject: The 1 Question That Builds Psychological Safety

In yesterday's stand-up, one of my senior engineers said: "I deployed a bug to production. Here's what I learned."

The team didn't flinch. They asked questions. They improved the process.

That moment didn't happen by accident. It happened because we've normalized vulnerability from the top down. When leaders share their mistakes first, it gives everyone else permission to do the same.

This week: In your next team meeting, start with "I made a mistake when..." and see what happens.

## Example Newsletter #2 (Technical Topic)

```
Subject: Why Your AI Agent Keeps Failing in Production

We spent 3 weeks debugging an agent that worked perfectly in dev but failed 40% of the time in production.

The issue? We treated it like traditional software. Deterministic inputs, deterministic outputs. But agents aren't deterministic—they're probabilistic systems that need different guardrails.

The fix: We added output validation, fallback paths, and explicit error boundaries. Production failures dropped to <2%.

This week: If you're building with agents, ask yourself: "What happens when the LLM returns something unexpected?"

## Writing Guidelines

### Subject Line (Under 50 chars)
**Do:**
- Be specific: "The 1 Question That Builds Psychological Safety"
- Create curiosity: "Why Your AI Agent Keeps Failing"
- Promise value: "3 Metrics That Predict Team Success"

**Don't:**
- Be vague: "Leadership Tips"
- Use clickbait: "You Won't Believe What Happened Next"
- Over-promise: "The SECRET to Perfect Teams"

### Opening Hook (1-2 sentences)
**Purpose:** Grab attention with a story, stat, or provocative statement

**Examples:**
- Story: "In yesterday's stand-up, one of my senior engineers said..."
- Stat: "40% of engineering leaders report feeling unprepared for AI adoption."
- Statement: "Most retrospectives are a waste of time."

**Pattern:**
```
[Specific moment/situation] → [Unexpected outcome or insight]
```

### Core Insight (3-4 sentences)
**Purpose:** Deliver the main learning or framework

**Structure:**
```
[Context/Problem] →
[What Miguel learned/discovered] →
[Why this matters]
```

**Keep:**
- Specific examples
- Metrics when relevant
- Personal experience
- Clear cause-effect

**Cut:**
- Long explanations
- Multiple sub-points
- Background context (save for blog)
- Hedging language

### Practical Takeaway (1 sentence)
**Purpose:** Give one clear action the reader can take

**Format:**
```
This week: [Specific action with context]
```

**Examples:**
- ✅ "This week: In your next 1-on-1, ask 'What's one thing I could do to help you succeed?'"
- ✅ "This week: Add output validation to your next agent implementation"
- ❌ "This week: Try to improve your communication" (too vague)
- ❌ "This week: Consider implementing these 5 strategies" (too many)

### Link to Blog (If applicable)

**Format:**
```
Read the full [framework/post/guide]: https://miketineo.com/blog/[slug]
```

**Phrases:**
- "Read the full framework:"
- "Read the full post:"
- "Get the complete guide:"
- "Dive deeper:"

### Call to Action

**Purpose:** Invite engagement and build relationship

**Types:**

1. **Reply CTA** (most personal)
   - "Reply and tell me how it goes"
   - "Hit reply if you've faced this challenge"
   - "Reply with your experience—I'd love to hear it"

2. **Share CTA** (when topic is shareable)
   - "Forward this to a fellow engineering leader"
   - "Share with your team if this resonates"

3. **Action CTA** (when asking for specific behavior)
   - "Try it this week and let me know what happens"
   - "Implement this and share your results"

4. **Question CTA** (to spark thinking)
   - "What's your answer to this question?"
   - "How would you have handled this?"

### Signature

**Always use:**
```

```

**Note:** Em dash (—), not hyphen (-) or double hyphen (--)

### P.S. (Optional)

**When to use:**
- Additional resource: "P.S. Here's the template I use: [link]"

- Related content: "P.S. Last week's post on [topic] is getting great feedback"
- Collection/survey: "P.S. I'm collecting [X]. Reply if you have one to share"

**When to skip:**
- When nothing adds value
- When newsletter is already at 200 words
- When CTA is already strong enough

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Long
"I want to share three major learnings from our recent incident at Hive, each of which taught me something different about how distributed systems behave under load, and how important it is to have proper observability and monitoring in place..."

**Problem:** Rambling, will exceed 200 words

### ✅ Right Length
"Last week, we had an outage. Root cause? A monitoring blind spot we didn't know existed. The lesson: Observability isn't optional for distributed systems—it's the foundation."

**Why it works:** Concise, specific, punchy

---

### ❌ Too Vague
"Leadership is important and something we should all work on. This week, try to be a better leader."

**Problem:** Generic, no specifics, no actionable takeaway

### ✅ Specific
"This week: In your next team meeting, start with 'I made a mistake when...' Watch how it changes the conversation."

**Why it works:** Concrete action, clear context

---

### ❌ Too Many Points
"Here are 5 things I learned about psychological safety: 1) Model vulnerability 2) Create norms 3) Make it safe to fail 4) Give feedback 5) Celebrate learning..."

**Problem:** Too much for a short newsletter, readers won't retain

### ✅ One Clear Point
"When leaders share their mistakes first, it gives everyone else permission to do the same. That's how you build psychological safety."

**Why it works:** One memorable insight

---

## Adaptation from Blog Post

When condensing a 1200-1500 word blog post to 150-200 word newsletter:

**Keep:**
- The opening story (1-2 sentences version)
- One core insight (the most important point)
- One actionable takeaway (pick the easiest to implement)
- Link to full post

**Cut:**
- Additional examples
- Supporting research (unless it's a key stat)
- Background context
- Multiple strategies (pick one)
- Detailed explanations

**Example:**

**Blog post sections:**
1. Why psychological safety matters
2. The remote challenge
3. Five strategies
4. Measuring progress
5. Key takeaways

**Newsletter focus:**
- Use opening story from section 1
- Highlight ONE strategy from section 3
- Link to full post for the other 4 strategies
