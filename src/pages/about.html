                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        I believe great engineering starts with people. Over the last decade, I've built and
                        scaled teams across the US and Europe, leading initiatives that bridged innovation
                        and culture. At Zendesk, Dutchie, and now Hive, I've helped teams grow sustainably‚Äîcombining
                        mentorship, clarity, and technical excellence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey in technology began with a deep curiosity about distributed systems and
                        cloud architecture. As I progressed in my career, I discovered that the most impactful
                        work wasn't just about building scalable systems‚Äîit was about building scalable teams
                        that could tackle increasingly complex challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I'm passionate about helping engineers grow into leaders, fostering cultures
                        of psychological safety and continuous learning, and architecting systems that balance
                        velocity with reliability. Whether it's reducing cloud costs by 20%, scaling services
                        to handle millions of requests, or mentoring junior engineers into senior roles, I
                        focus on measurable impact that serves both people and business outcomes.

                    <p>
                        At <a href="https://hivenet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hivenet.com</a>, I'm leading engineering
                        efforts to build next-generation distributed cloud infrastructure while driving organization-wide AI
                        adoption initiatives. We're reimagining how reliable, affordable storage and compute solutions can
                        leverage decentralized technology‚Äîand how AI agents can enhance every part of the development lifecycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm particularly focused on <strong>Agentic Engineering</strong>: enabling teams to build systems where
                        AI agents augment human decision-making, automate complex workflows, and accelerate innovation. This
                        means establishing patterns for agent-based architectures, building team capabilities around LLM-powered
                        tools, and creating frameworks that let engineers ship faster without sacrificing quality or reliability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The intersection of distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and AI is where I spend most of my time‚Äî
                        whether that's architecting agent-driven deployment pipelines, implementing AI-assisted observability,
                        or coaching teams on how to effectively integrate these technologies into their daily practice.
